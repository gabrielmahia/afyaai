Provide:
1. **Possible conditions** (list 3-4, from most to least likely for Kenya context — consider malaria, typhoid, TB, common in your ranking)
2. **Urgency level**: Emergency (go now) / Urgent (go today) / Soon (within 48 hours) / Self-care possible
3. **Recommended action**: Which level of facility to visit (dispensary, health centre, Level 4, Level 5)
4. **What to tell the healthcare provider** (key information to share)
5. **Self-care measures** while waiting to see a provider (if appropriate)
6. **Red flags**: Signs that mean you must go immediately regardless

Important: 
- For pregnant patients, be conservative — recommend care sooner
- Consider local disease burden (malaria in lakeshore, TB in urban, meningitis in ASALs)
- Do NOT provide definitive diagnosis. Frame as "possible" and "see a provider"
